### üìñ My Coding Journey


My journey into programming and technology started in a pretty fun way. I was playing Minecraft and creating intros for YouTube using Cinema 4D. That got me curious and eager to explore more.

Then, I stumbled upon a video about programming in Python, and I fell in love with coding right away. Programming really hooked me! But due to some complications, I had to take a break from my studies.

In May 2024, I decided to get back into it. I started studying at Alura and Rocketseat, aiming to become a fullstack developer. I'm also diving into UX/UI Design to enhance my skills. Since then, I've been focused on learning everything I can to create projects from scratch, from planning to design to coding.
